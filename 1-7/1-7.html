<!--
    1-7)	By using the concept of prototype, add a capability to the current String class 
    so that a method called CountDoubles can count the number of times a charter is repeated 
    in the string instantly, and then test your function on different strings to make sure your 
    function works correctly.  For instance, if you test your functions on “Well” and “apple” it 
    should produce 1, because in the first word, l, and in the second word, p has been instantly 
    repeated 1 time. On the other hand, if you apply it on “Tara” it should produce 0 because none 
    of the characters have been instantly repeated. Finally, if you test it on “Pssstuup” the result 
    should be 3 because “s” has been instantly repeated twice and “u” has been instantly repeated 
    once, 2+1=3.
